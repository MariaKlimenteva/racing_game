2) Map display on SDL window
3) Machine Physics + keystroke processing (Grigory)
4) User interface: menu with buttons to start the game (Alexander)
5) Displaying the car on the SDL window + connection with the physics of the car (Maria)
6) General game logic and structure (Maria)

8) Points and time counter
### How the project works
The car moves across the screen by pressing the keys: W, A, D, space. Your task in the game is not to run into obstacles and earn as many points as possible. In the table of records you can find your personal records.
### How to build and run
To build, run the root cmake (requires a vcpkg submodule).
